subtitle: Information Blocking and Data Liquidity in Healthcare

Information blocking and data liquidity have been lingering issues within healthcare for quite a while and are gaining ever greater attention with the push toward value-based healthcare. Information blocking received press with CMS and HHS looking at future rulings that will incent IT vendors and providers to be more open with their data.

The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) weighed in on the issue of “information blocking” in a Report to Congress in April 2015:

_Allegations continue to surface that some health care providers and health IT developers are interfering with the exchange or use of electronic health information in ways that frustrate the goals of the HITECH Act and undermine broader health care reforms. In addition, current economic incentives and characteristics of both health care and health IT markets create business incentives for some market participants to pursue and exercise control over information in ways that significantly limit its availability and use. And as health information exchange becomes more technologically and financially feasible for many stakeholders, some persons and entities will inevitably regard this trend towards greater information sharing and data liquidity as contrary to their specific business or economic interests. These actors may resist or even seek to prevent the sharing of health information._

Participants at the 2016 LAN Summit in April voiced their frustrations on the subject of data blocking and the cost prohibitive usurious fees associated with pulling clinical data to make meaningful data driven decisions. The charges levied against IT vendors were as if you were hearing a historical account of the Robber Barons on the Rhine River in 1300AD.

**Origination of “Robber Barons”**
This period of antiquity is how the term, “Robber Baron” originated.

Nobility, under the auspices of the Roman Empire, historically had been allowed to collect tolls from passer-bys along the main transportation route of the time — -the Rhine River — in order to finance certain services offered. Following the fall of the Roman Empire, rogue nobility, aka “robber barons”, would close access to narrow passages of the Rhine and solicit tolls in purely extractionary means.

Put simply, they were engaging in rent-seeking behavior. In economics, the concept of a rent is where you can extract wealth from others without providing services that will help those be better-of.

**Relation to Contemporary Healthcare**
We need to mitigate rent-seeking behavior to have a functional market in healthcare that delivers value to patients and key stakeholders.

Panelists at the LAN Summit discussed the importance of data flow and data liquidity. Some even proclaimed ushering the end of proprietary business models that hoard health information. That these models will have “their Uber moment”.

Are IT vendors’ proprietary business models the modern day gatekeepers that are blocking the forward flow of information? We can turn to the 2016 Black Book Inpatient EHR Surveys to get a sense of where EHR users’ sympathies lye. The survey consisted of a loyalty index, which was broken down into quadrants: “most loyal”, “reachable”, “trapped” and “top risk”. Epic and MEDITECH were listed in the “trapped” quadrants, while Cerner, Evident CPSI, athenahealth and T-System were in the “most loyal” quadrant.

The robber baron card shouldn’t be thrown out too hastily. Myriad of factors don’t allow for easy categorization. John Kay at the Financial Times has a great perspective on this (lengthy excerpt):

_The acceleration of economic growth since the 13th century is partly the result of the substitution of competitive markets for the archbishops’ monopoly. The French autoroute from Mulhouse to Karlsruhe is, exceptionally, free because it competes with the untolled German autobahn on the right bank. But, as the 13th-century experience shows, we need not just competition but the right sort of competition. The key to growth was redirecting the entrepreneurial energy of men like von Hohenfels from brigandry to productive business.
The figures of the gilded age, such as Rockefeller, Gould and Morgan, were engaged in both activities, perhaps to varied degrees. Today, the courts must decide whether the rewards of men such as Jeff Skilling, the jailed Enron chief executive, and Conrad Black, the former owner of The Daily Telegraph released from prison last month, resemble more closely the wages of the captain of the Rhine barge (admirable), the revenues of the Archbishop of Trier (despicable but innocent) or the booty of the robber baron, von Hohenfels (greedy and criminal).
Nor is it easy to decide whether the hedge funds that helped bring down Enron and expose Lord Black are the equivalent of the militias that stormed the castles or the toll collectors who impeded the flow of economic activity.
The distinction between the creation and the appropriation of wealth — between those who add value to the cargo and those who help themselves to a fraction of it as it sails by — is vital, if not always clear. But our ability to recognise it will determine, not just the fate of individuals, but the future of modern capitalism.”
The robber barons practices were eventually put into check by the Rhine League, an association of different factions that came together to ransack Robber barons’ estates that were indulging in these rent-seeking behaviors._

Today, we hopefully aren’t going to go down to the IT Vendors HQs and start ransacking their offices. We should however pursue data governance policies that create norms around data sharing in a world of alternative payment models that demand (in practice and in certain instances by legislation)appropriate and adequate knowledge sharing occurs to properly share risk.

**Steps taken toward solutions**
CommonWell Health Alliance is a collaborative of EHR vendors that is taking the steps to bring about these improved data governance policies. According to their mission statement — “creating and executing a vendor-neutral platform that breaks down the technological and process barriers that currently inhibit effective health data exchange. And we are committed to defining and promoting a national infrastructure with common standards and policies.”

CommonWell is a great first step toward this, but if the frustrations voiced at the Summit and the 2016 Black Book EHR Survey results are indications of the current state of affairs, then we have a long way to go to ensuring data liquidity along the cyber-Rhine of Healthcaretopia.
