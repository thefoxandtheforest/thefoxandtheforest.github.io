A vision advocated by Enrico Moretti, the UC Berkeley Econoomist and author of The New GEorgaphy of Jobs, suggests to double down on the coastal digerati and points to the economic boom, to a tune of 9% GDP bump, if we just laxed zoning laws to accomodate more migration to high tech productivity clusters such as the Bay Area and New York.

Joel Kotkin has an alternative vision that is summed up nicely in the title of a recent book, Urbanism For The Rest Of Us. Its more inclusive in terms of highlighting opportunity available to the majority of the population that lacks the pedigree of the Digerati.

This isn't to say Moretti's analysis is lacking consideration of non tech roles. In fact one of the key soundbites used referencing the New Geography of Jobs is that for each tech job created 5 service sector jobs are created.

Kotkin is less bullish on the tech industry specifically being the harbringer of economic propserity. Is this skepticism warranted? I think so but with the caveat that "Software is Eating the World" a la the mantra of a16z General Partner Marc Andreeson. Every company is becoming a technology company. Kotkin looks to energy sector employers more optimistically as creating more inclusive economic prosperity with corresponding job gains.

Moving forward, what factors impact which vision more wins out? It's yet to be determined how the tech industry broadly handles a boom and bust, even though it has successfuly navigated tested waters in the past with the tech bust in the early 2000s and then subsequent boom and weathering the 2007 Financial Crisis.

Despite the doom and gloom of artifical intelligence, human engenuity is still the most scarecst human resource so where the talent goes will be the indication of which vision best approximates with reality. This leads to its own set of questions:
Are individuals priced out of productivity clusters? How are governments are going to respond in terms of zoning? How are tech giants going to respond in terms of office placement? Where are the "scencesters" going to?

The most striking indictment against Moretti's and a league of retrourbanists' vision of tech clusters is what Joel Kotkin describes as a neofeudalism. The privileged class of the technorati may usher in other jobs but what type of prosperity do these supporting actors attain given the rise in living expenses as most noticeably seen in housing sectors in coastal cities such as SF and NYC?
This bifurcation of society is detailed in Tyler Cowen's excellent book "Average is Over". The privileged 1% will broaden to the top 20% while a shrinking middle class leads to a lower middle-class existence for the majority of society.

So where do we go from here?

There's broad scale support for a human scale urbanism, and the internal strife as epitomized by the google bus protests in SF indicates that peaceful coexistence isn't to follow with a mad dash of the populace back to the city core.Â 

Given young families' proclivity to the suburbs, how do "suburbs reinvented" fit in the ecosystem of a metropolitan area? Given the "growth ponzi scheme" as articulated by Charles Mahon at Strong Towns, how do we build 'Strong Towns' that are sustainable socially and financially over time?
