_Fox knows many things, but the Hedgehog knows one big thing_ - Archilochus 

Unfortunately, research by Tetlock et al. and the 'lived experience' of us all have shown that often each of our one big thing is horrifically off-base.  Instead we combine the many little things with the random forest's "many weak learners combined turn into a strong learner" as the basis of our approach.  Further, the advantage of the fox is the willingness to experiment & update.  Instead of the Hedgehog's immovable mountain made of stone, foxes tend ever-expanding networks of trees, rivers, etc to comprise its forest.

We believe storytelling is an absolutely needed ingredient for a recipe in developing 21st century data & business literacy.  Storytelling needs to occur at every level [Micro-Meso-Macro] in our figurative forest.
1. [Micro] We will walk alongside the fox with specific code tutorials executing our ideas and mental heuristics for common interaction typically encountered across different terrain.  
2. [Meso] We will also be ziplining through the trees to look at the common processes and frameworks underlying the micro-based actions implemented/recommended above.
3. [Macro] And sometimes we will even take a hot air balloon up near the atmosphere to try to see the big picture. But we must ensure that the hot air only serves as a technical tool to rise above the trees and doesn't have rhetoric (aka fluff aka MBA talk) serve as a crutch in place of substance
